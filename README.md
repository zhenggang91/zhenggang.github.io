# Portfolio

**Delivery and Ride Hailing Classifer**

Applying Natural Language Processing to uberEATS and uber subreddits, my group built classifier models using Naive Bayes, K Nearest Neighbours and Logistic Regression. We chose Naive Bayes model as our best model as it has the highest accuracy score of 0.775. Through our app, we then applied this model to Grab reviews on Google Play Store to classify between delivery reviews and ride hailing reviews. Our app is able to classify the reviews in a fast and accurate manner.

**Singapore Housing Price Estimation with High Accuracy**

Implemented Lasso and Ridge regression models, achieving R-squared of 0.90 in Singapore housing price prediction. This project involved extensive data cleansing, normalization, and feature engineering, optimizing for predictive accuracy. Developed a Streamlit application for real-time model interaction, showcasing model performance metrics and dynamic price forecast visualization. This work was collaboratively undertaken with Eugene Matthew Cheong and Pius Yee, contributing significantly to the project's success.
