# Portfolio

**Delivery and Ride Hailing Classifer**

![Grab Project Image](images/grab.png)

Utilizing Natural Language Processing techniques on the uberEATS and uber subreddits, our team developed classifier models employing Naive Bayes, K Nearest Neighbours, and Logistic Regression algorithms. After comprehensive evaluation, we determined the Naive Bayes model to be the most effective, boasting an accuracy score of 77.7%. Subsequently, we integrated this model into our application, which efficiently categorizes Grab reviews on the Google Play Store into delivery and ride-hailing segments. This application facilitates swift and precise classification of reviews. Ng Wei and Irfan Muzafar made significant contributions to this project.

Implemented Lasso and Ridge regression models, achieving R-squared of 0.90 in Singapore housing price prediction. This project involved extensive data cleansing, normalization, and feature engineering, optimizing for predictive accuracy. Developed a Streamlit application for real-time model interaction, showcasing model performance metrics and dynamic price forecast visualization. This work was collaboratively undertaken with Eugene Matthew Cheong and Pius Yee, contributing significantly to the project's success.
